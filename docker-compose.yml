    # Sets the command to run when the container starts.
    # IMPORTANT: You must change "python app.py" to the actual command that starts your application.
    # For example: "flask run --host=0.0.0.0" or "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app"

    # Mounts your project folder on your local machine to the /app directory inside the container.
    # This means code changes you make locally are instantly available inside the container.
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    # Maps port 8000 on your local machine to port 8000 in the container.
    # If your app listens on a different port (e.g., 5000), change this to "5000:5000".
    ports:
