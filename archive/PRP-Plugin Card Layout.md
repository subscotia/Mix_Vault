### **Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)**

### **Feature: Plugin Card Layout**

### **Version: 1.0**

#### **Objective**

To modify the index.html file to dynamically generate a responsive grid of "plugin cards" from the fetched JSON data. This will replace the current raw text display with a structured, visual representation of the vault's contents.

### **Execution Plan**

#### **Phase 1: HTML Structure Modification (index.html)**

1. **Identify Target Container:** The existing \<main\> content area currently contains a div with id="json-container". This div will be repurposed as the main grid container for the plugin cards.  
2. **Modify Container:**  
   * Remove the placeholder text from within the \#json-container div.  
   * Add Tailwind CSS grid classes to this div to establish the responsive grid layout. The classes will be: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6.  
     * grid: Establishes the element as a grid container.  
     * grid-cols-1: Default to a single column on the smallest screens.  
     * sm:grid-cols-2: Use two columns on small screens and up.  
     * lg:grid-cols-3: Use three columns on large screens and up.  
     * xl:grid-cols-4: Use four columns on extra-large screens and up.  
     * gap-6: Defines the spacing between grid items.

#### **Phase 2: JavaScript Logic Modification (index.html)**

The existing \<script\> tag will be significantly modified. The fetch call will remain, but the logic within the .then() block will be replaced with the following steps:

1. **Get Container:** Get a reference to the \#json-container element.  
2. **Clear Container:** Before adding new content, ensure the container is empty by setting its innerHTML to ''. This removes the "Loading data..." message.  
3. **Iterate Data:** Use a forEach loop to iterate over the array of plugin objects returned from the API (data.forEach(plugin \=\> { ... });).  
4. **For Each Plugin, Create a Card:** Inside the loop, for each plugin object:  
   * **a. Create Card Element:** Create a new \<div\> element for the card using document.createElement('div').  
   * **b. Style Card Element:** Apply Tailwind CSS classes to the card div to style it according to the "Studio Gear Chic" vibe: bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-4 flex flex-col.  
   * **c. Create Content:** Create the inner HTML for the card. This will be a template literal string containing div and span elements to structure the name, developer, and type. Each element will have specific Tailwind classes for typography (font size, weight, color) to create a clear visual hierarchy.  
     * The name will be the most prominent (font-bold, text-lg).  
     * The developer will be secondary (text-sm, text-gray-600).  
     * The type will be displayed in a small, styled "badge" or "tag" for quick identification (bg-sky-100 text-sky-800 text-xs font-semibold mr-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-full).  
   * **d. Populate Card:** Set the innerHTML of the card div to the generated content string.  
   * **e. Append Card:** Append the newly created and populated card div to the \#json-container.

#### **Final Review**

* Confirm that the JavaScript logic correctly loops through the data and creates distinct HTML elements for each entry.  
* Verify that the Tailwind CSS classes for the grid and the individual cards are correctly applied to achieve the desired responsive layout and "Studio Gear Chic" aesthetic.  
* Ensure the final implementation replaces the raw JSON dump entirely.

**Approval Request:** The Product Director is requested to review this PRP. Upon approval, the Code Engine will proceed with the execution phase.
