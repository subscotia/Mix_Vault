## Is Bolt DIY Free?

**Yes, Bolt DIY is completely free and open-source.**
You can download, install, and use it on your own machine without any subscription or license costs. The only costs you may incur are for the API usage of large language models (like Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI), but the application itself does not charge any fees or require payment[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6].

## Is Bolt DIY Resource Intensive?

**Bolt DIY is built for flexibility and relatively modest requirements:**

- It runs in your browser but is developed to be usable on typical developer workstations and older machines.
- **Minimum requirements:**
    - Modern browser (Chrome 114+, Firefox 109+)
    - Node.js version 18 or higher
    - At least 4GB RAM (8GB is recommended for better performance, but many users report running it with less)
    - Basic CPU (most multi-core desktop CPUs are fine; high-end GPUs are not required)[^5][^7].
- **Resource use:**
    - It is not considered particularly resource intensive in local/single-user settings.
    - Browser-based "WebContainers" add a safety layer but can impose some performance limits.
    - It is designed to run projects for rapid prototyping and development rather than heavy, production-scale web serving[^1][^8][^5].


## Running Bolt DIY on a Local Dell Optiplex

- **Installation:**
You can install Bolt DIY on your Dell Optiplex by following the official instructions. Main dependencies are Node.js and a package manager (pnpm), both of which are light on resources[^8][^5][^7].
- **Serving Web Apps Locally:**
    - After generating a web app with Bolt DIY, you can export the code (ZIP or folder).
    - You can deploy the app to your studio's web server (such as your Optiplex) regardless of its performance tier, as the generated apps are standard Node.js/JavaScript applications.
    - For serving just one user on your local network, even an older Dell Optiplex (with >4GB RAM and a modern OS) should be more than sufficient[^5][^8].
- **Considerations for Low-Powered Servers:**
    - Since you're serving only 1 local user, resource requirements are minimal.
    - If the web app is simple/static or a lightweight Node.js/React app, you will most likely not encounter any performance issues.
    - For very large or complex AI-powered web apps, performance may be limited by your server’s CPU/RAM, but for typical single-user scenarios, this is rarely a problem[^5].


## Typical Workflow

1. **Develop the app locally with Bolt DIY.**
2. **Export the app’s source or build output.**
3. **Deploy the app to your Optiplex web server** (Node.js, Python, or even simple file servers, depending on the app).
4. **Access the app from any device on your network.**

## Summary Table

| Feature | Bolt DIY (Local) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Free to use? | Yes |
| Open source? | Yes |
| Resource requirements | Low-medium (4GB+ RAM, Node.js, modern CPU) |
| Suitable for older PCs? | Yes, for single-user/local use |
| Can you export web apps? | Yes (ZIP or folder) |
| Can you serve on local network? | Yes |
| 1-user, low-powered server OK? | Yes |

**In short:**
Bolt DIY is free, lightweight enough for local development on typical PCs (including an Optiplex), and easily exports apps you can serve on your local network—even with modest hardware and a single user in your studio[^1][^2][^3][^8][^5].
