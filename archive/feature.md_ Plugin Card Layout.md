### **Feature Context: Plugin Card Layout**

### **Version: 1.0**

#### **1\. Feature Description**

The goal of this feature is to parse the fetched JSON data from the vault and dynamically render each plugin as an individual "card" within the main content area. This will replace the current raw JSON text display.

#### **2\. User Story**

As a user, I want to see each plugin presented as a distinct visual card, so I can quickly scan the list and identify plugins by their most important attributes (name, developer, and type).

#### **3\. Core Requirements**

* The JavaScript logic must iterate over the array of plugin objects received from the /api/vault endpoint.  
* For each plugin object, a new HTML element (e.g., a \<div\>) must be created to serve as the card.  
* Each card must clearly display the following data fields from the JSON object:  
  * name  
  * developer  
  * type  
* The dynamically created cards must be appended into a container element within the \<main\> content area.  
* The cards should be arranged in a responsive grid. The grid should adapt to the screen size, showing fewer columns on smaller screens (e.g., 1-2) and more columns on larger screens (e.g., 3-4).

#### **4\. Vibe & Aesthetic**

* **Overall Vibe:** "Studio Gear Chic". The cards should feel like small, tangible pieces of professional equipment. They need to be clear, legible, and uncluttered.  
* **Analogy:** The design of each card could be inspired by the faceplate of a classic hardware rack unit. This implies a strong sense of structure, clear typographic hierarchy, and efficient use of space.  
* **Color Palette:** Continue with the neutral greys established in the main layout. The card background should be a slightly different shade (e.g., bg-white or a very light grey) to distinguish it from the main content area's background.

#### **5\. Known Constraints**

* This task is focused solely on displaying the primary information (name, developer, type). Additional details like families and tags will be added in a later iteration.  
* Card interactivity (e.g., click events, hover effects) is out of scope for this task and will be addressed later.
