**Subject: Phase 4 Complete \- Data Management Interface**

**Date:** 30 July 2025

Summary:  
This commit marks the successful completion of Phase 4\. The application has been extended from a read-only tool to a fully-fledged data management interface. A user can now add new plugin entries directly through the web UI, with the data being safely processed and saved on the backend.

* **Task 4.1: "Add New Plugin" Form UI:**  
  * A new "Add Plugin" button was added to the header.  
  * A comprehensive modal form was designed and built with input fields for all necessary plugin data, adhering to our established themes.  
* **Task 4.2: Backend API Endpoint:**  
  * A new API endpoint (/api/plugin) was created in the Flask application, configured to accept POST requests.  
  * The endpoint was successfully tested to receive and parse JSON data submitted from the frontend form.  
* **Task 4.3: Save Logic Implementation:**  
  * A shared utils.py module was created to house a save\_vault\_with\_backup function, adhering to our "safe save" best practice.  
  * The backend was enhanced with logic to generate a new, globally unique ID for each submitted plugin, following the schema in VAULT\_GUIDE.md.  
  * The /api/plugin endpoint now uses these utilities to append the new plugin to the vault\_master.json file and create a timestamped backup.  
* **Task 4.4: Auto-Refresh UI:**  
  * The frontend JavaScript was updated to handle the success response from the backend.  
  * Upon a successful save, the application now automatically adds the new plugin to its in-memory data, re-populates the filter lists, and re-renders the main plugin grid without requiring a page reload.  
  * A significant ReferenceError was diagnosed and resolved, leading to a more robust, correctly-scoped script structure.

The application's core feature set for local management is now complete. The project is ready to proceed to the final phase: production deployment.
