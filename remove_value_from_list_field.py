remove_value_from_list_field.py

üéØ PURPOSE:
Scans a vault and removes a specific value from a specified list-based
field (e.g., 'families', 'tags') in every entry where it is found.

üõ°Ô∏è SAFE:
- It will only attempt to modify fields that are lists. It will not cause
  errors on fields that are strings, numbers, or null.
- If removing the value results in an empty list, the field will be saved
  as an empty list `[]`, maintaining data type consistency.
- Creates a timestamped backup before saving any changes.

üîß TWEAKABLE CONFIGURATION:
- You can change the vault file, the target field, and the value to remove
  in the '--- CONFIGURATION ---' block.
