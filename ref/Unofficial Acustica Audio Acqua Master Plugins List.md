In a June 2023 update, three soft clipping modes were [added to Ash and Jam](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fgearspace.com%2Fboard%2Fproduct-alerts-older-than-2-months%2F1395113-introducing-ash-acustica-audios-new-clipping-mastering-converter-plug-17.html).  
Yellow K3 Extended +6, Yellow S Extended +6 and Yellow S Extended Smoothed +6. 

  
Tips: For mixes, generally aim for 1 to 2 dB of gain reduction. That's it!  
Make use of the Delta feature to hear how your audio is being affected.

Stedal Preset Notes:  
"All of them have been sampled from real hardware objects, namely some simple (or sometimes not so simple) clipper circuits that I had lying around or made up for this specific occasion. And all of them exploit the behaviour of different electronic components when pushed to their limits.  
  
The LED preset, for instance, takes advantage of the rather sharp clipping that a red light emitting diode produces whenever the input signal rises above its forward voltage (about 1.6 volt, in this case).  
  
The way a FET (field effect transistor) clips is somewhat softer than the former, and even more so the clipper based on a pair of Germanium diodes. Actually, this preset (the infamous Stedal Diode) is maybe the smoothest of them all, even coming closer to a saturator rather than a pure clipper.  
  
The two 'Trafo' presets were created by overdriving a smallish input transformer. In this regard, please note that in Ash you won't get any particular frequency response in any preset. Therefore these two 'Trafo' presets won't give you the classic low frequency saturation of an iron core; they are just meant to apply the clipping shape of an overdriven transformer to the whole frequency range.  
  
Stedal Neon: In this case, the clipping element is a small neon lamp, which usually takes at least about 60 V to conduct. I had built a very aggressive sounding fuzz box based on this principle, so we thought that it could have been a good candidate for some extreme analog clipping. The 'Neon' preset you find in Ash has been sampled from that fuzz box, which, by the way, makes a fine show of itself also in the Aero fuzzbox collection. "  
  
  
**Ash Ultra** (19.5) - Updated version of the Ash mastering/high end converter clipper collection. Hyper 3 technology.  
  
Same hardware models as Ash, but with a new interface (codename Aria) that helps users visualize in real time what is happening with their processing.   
  
New features include dither and bit depth options, advanced anti-aliasing oversampling, Ceiling options and more. From the user manual:   
  
• TPDF 2 is a TPDF derived from the differentiation of an RPDF. The key distinction  
between TPDF and TPDF 2 is that TPDF 2 features a 6dB/octave slope  
towards high frequencies.  
  
• Psychoacoustic is a highly conservative option.  
• Psychoacoustic 2 is somewhat similar but less conservative.

  
• Entropic employs rather aggressive noise shaping curves.

  
• Smoother resembles a more restrained version of a renowned dithering product  
on the market, introducing slightly more noise in the ~8-15kHz range.  
• Smoother 2 adopts a steeper design with a similar concept, closely resembling a well-known dithering algorithm celebrated for enhancing resolution while maintaining a smooth, natural sound and avoiding extreme high-frequency peaks.

**Aubergine** (20, Hyper 3) - The Malcolm Toft Collection  


Lead designer behind the famous Trident consoles.

Toft 70's Strip: Malcolm Toft [MICMIX](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malcolmtoft.com%2Fmicmix) \+ [EQUATE](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malcolmtoft.com%2Fequate) or Toft Audio ATB24 or Trident Series 70. From the hardware sampler himself:  
"[The Strip] is an amalgamation of a variety of designs chosen to create a classic Toft EQ. Some are vintage, others recreated on a circuit level by Malcolm specifically for the purpose of sampling...The mids aren’t particularly narrow, so don’t think surgical cuts here. Instead, the magic of the EQ is in its workflow, the way the bands interact with each other and the different character of each section.  
  
There are also two sets of identical very smooth filters. These interact in specific way with the shelves in the EQ and also affect in a logical way the saturation behaviour. Think Shelf + Filter = something like a flat top peak. They are also very useful for controlling the boosts in the EQ Colour preamp."

The sound is large, open, sweet and extremely detailed/accurate, with a three-dimensional soundstage that other converters at twice its price cannot match. Goes on the used market for around $2,500.

• DEN-X32: Digital Audio Denmark AX32, A solid-state multi-track converter designed in Denmark, known for its immaculate clarity and detail, widely used in professional studios for its precision and reliability.

Retails for $4,000. Described as pristine/audiophile grade. Usually referred to as the DAD AX32. Neutral/uncolored...sounds like what's coming out of the console before recording.

• BMB-0B2: Burl Audio - B2 Bomber ADC, A 2-channel solid-state unit made in the USA, adding rich, colored tones with subtle harmonic saturation, ideal for injecting warmth and character into recordings.

Now we're getting into the colored converter territory. Designed to have the warmth and feel of analog tape recordings. "Everything sounds bigger and less processing will be needed". Released in the year 2010.  
  
Depth/weight/analog vibe. Vocals chain, find the saturation sweet spot.   


• RNM-002: Rupert Neve Designs Master Buss Converter, A 2-channel solid-state design from the USA,delivering warm, musical tones with a vintage-inspired analog character, enhancing the richness of mixes.

The hardware can either be transformerless if transparency is desired or users can choose to add transformers to the path. Then, manually drive harmonic saturation with the Silk control. One of the newer converters in Daisy's collection, released in the year 2020.

• EPX-073: Euphonix AM713, This multi-track solid-state converter from the USA ensures clean and accurate signal conversion, offering transparency and precision for professional results.

It appears to have been primarily used for obtaining an uncolored sound from analog consoles and multi-track tapes to the MADI professional digital format. It's a "vintage multi-track converter", compared to the GAX-032 which is a modern design.

The AM713 was built in the late 1990s/early 2000s for the Avid System 5 digital audio mixing system and R1 recorder. Euphonix were allegedly right there in contention with better known brands like Lavry, Benchmark and Apogee. Retailed brand new for about $8,000. The guy who runs Lindell Audio and GRAMMY award winning engineer Michael Wagener really liked them back in the day:

• GAX-032: Antelope Audio Galaxy 32, A modern European multi-track solid-state converter, praised for its pristine fidelity and accuracy, perfect for high-resolution recording projects. Debuted in the year 2021.

Modern multi-track converters that work with the newer digital standards. Currently retails for about $6,000.

Advertised as "mastering grade converters". In a word, they are "honest" quality. As transparent as modern technology allows.

DACs

• FRS-02A: Forssell Technologies MADA-2a, An American 2-channel (for mixdown and mastering) solid-state converter that matches its ADC counterpart with transparent, neutral output, ensuring critical accuracy for mastering.

Circuit design includes Class A JFET and no integrated circuit (IC) opamps in the signal path.

**On more than one occasion, I read reviews that stated the Forrsell adding a little "enhancement", which fits pop/electronic/hip-hop and rock music better than a classical or jazz recording.**

Sells for about $3,000-4,500 on the used market.

• BRI-01M: Bricasti Design M1, 

This 2-channel solid-state DAC from the USA provides rich, detailed, and dynamic sound, enhancing depth and resolution in mixes. Released in the year 2011 for the high end consumer audio market. Designed and built entirely in the USA. Uses the Analog Devices Inc. AD1955 converter.

Retail price when new: $8,700. Features a choice of 15 digital reconstruction filters. All PCM audio is internally upsampled to 5.6 MHz. Based on the M7 reverb converters. The M1 is a "no expenses spared" product. 

"Smooths out the treble region a little, making it more forgiving of less than ideal digital sources." 

**This could be beneficial to engineers who are processing tracks that were recorded on low end audio interfaces.**

• DEN-X32: Digital Audio Denmark AX32 (also known as DAD AX32), A multi-track solid-state unit designed in Denmark, delivering ultra-clean and detailed output, ideal for workflows requiring precision and neutrality.

Year 2014 technology.

A great choice when you want a "straight wire" professional grade digital to analog converter. As stated before with the ADC, a lot of famous GRAMMY winning engineers swear by it. **For Jazz/orchestral/film scoring multi-track mixing emulation, it would be a good choice.**

• VIV-001: dCS Puccini or possibly the Vivaldi, A 2-channel solid-state DAC from the UK, renowned for its analytical precision, making it perfect for revealing fine details in audio. Released in the year 2007.

Consumer grade audiophile equipment, similar to the Bricasti M1. More expensive than the Bricasti, however, at $18,000 when new. Currently selling on the used market for around $7,000 with its U-Clock accessory. Great "liquid" sounding midrange. Low grain/edginess[/URL] on transients.

Possesses a "background" sound to it as opposed to "forward" presentation. Instrumental separation. Pristine but never cold/clinical. 

• DEL-001: dCS Delius, This 2-channel solid-state unit from the UK offers accurate reproduction with exceptional balance and clarity, suitable for critical listening. Released in the year 1999.

Clarity but with tube-like warmth. Similar to the Bricasti M1, it enhances lesser quality digital source material. Adds "mass" to music playback. "Effortless, holographic, elegant and realistic".

• MCS-D10: McIntosh Labs D1100 

A 2-channel solid-state DAC from the USA that adds a warm, inviting tone, ideal for mastering tracks with musical richness and smoothness. A consumer audiophile grade preamp and DAC, first manufactured in the year 2016. Uses the ESS Sabre ES9018 DAC chip. 

An iconic American made audio brand. The Grateful Dead used McIntosh amps while on tour. They were one of the first companies to sell a media server (Music Streamer) to consumers back in the year 2007. "Sometimes seems to over emphasize details, but in a pleasing way." "Euphonic in a tube sort of way...puts air around instruments".

• COM-543: Computer Audio Design 1543 MKII DAC

A 2-channel non-oversampling resistor-ladder DAC from a UK-based company, delivering organic, natural sound with unique warmth, cherished by audiophiles. Uses 16 "vintage" Philips TDA1543/N2 resistor-ladder chips.

Released in the year 2015, in order to "get the best possible sound out of a computer". Design goal was to use as few components as possible. No switches in the digital signal. Very minimalist engineering design choices. Unlike other DACs, no digital interpolation filters or oversampling is present in the 1543 design.

"The key reason why we use Resistor Ladder DAC technology in our 1543 MKII DAC is due to the excellent time domain response that a Resistor Ladder DAC offers. This is best explained with two graphs.

Impulse response is when we apply a digital input to a DAC that consists of a short impulse (~5usec) of maximum level (~0dB) and then look at the analogue output of the DAC. CAD believes the analogue output impulse response of a DAC is one of the key attributes of DAC architecture that relates to sound quality."

• ACP-770: Accuphase DP-770 

A hybrid 2-channel DAC from Japan that combines solid-state precision with analog warmth, providing detailed and musical output. Released in the year 2023, with the ESS Sabre Audiophile ES9028PRO 32bit Hyper Stream Ⅱ DAC as the centerpiece.

A $17,000 Beautiful gold face plate and top wood panel SuperAudio CD/DVD player. Also accepts auxillary digital inputs.  
"The digital processor section consists of a unique “8MDSD (DSD signal)/8MDS++ (PCM signal)” D/A converter driven by eight ESS Technology ES9028PRO circuits in parallel, and a unique ANCC in the IV conversion circuit for improved performance, resulting in extremely high This enables extremely high conversion accuracy, low distortion and low noise."  


• PRL-100: PrimaLuna EVO 100 Tube DAC, Year 2019 production. Two chipsets. The Texas Instruments SRC4192 for upconversion and a Burr Brown PCM1792A DAC.  
  


This tube-based 2-channel DAC from the Netherlands delivers lush, smooth audio with harmonic richness and depth.

Unlike most of the others, does not market itself as reference/mastering grade. It has plenty of detail but it's not boring.

It's got tubes! Including the clock. EL34 stock but I'm not sure what kind Acustica sampled. It's also got transformers! If a colored DAC is what you're after, the PRL-100 is a good place to start. **The rock and big band music DAC?** Perhaps...but it's not limited to those genres.

• AAT-002: Accustic Arts Tube DAC II, A 2-channel tube DAC from Germany that produces a rich, colored sound with warm, immersive tones, ideal for emotionally engaging playback.

First introduced in the year 2007. Two ECC83 triode tubes, ten OPA627 op-amps contribute to its sound. 

"Creates a great sonic illusion that the musicians are in the room with you." Can be a bit too bright on some music.

• EPX-073: Euphonix MA703, a multi-track solid-state converter from the USA, ensuring clean and precise output with a transparent character to complement its ADC counterpart.

I don't have anything to add that wasn't already described in [the ADC section](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fgearspace.com%2Fboard%2Fshowpost%2A.%2Aphp%3Fp%3D17331479%26amp%3Bpostcount%3D166). Use this model for multi-tracks/mixing to emulate a large format console setup.

• GAX-032: Antelope Audio Galaxy 32, 

A European solid-state multi-track DAC that offers modern, transparent output, designed for high-resolution mastering and playback.

Another multi-track digital to analog converter emulator that is used for mixing, primarily but can obviously be used for mixdown and mastering too. This is the most modern of all Daisy's sampled models.

Buff MAS - Overstayer M-A-S (_thanks dubguy99 via GS_)  
Buff MAS 2 - Overstayer M-A-S 2nd mode  
Description: Rounds off and bends peaks for increased perceived loudness without compression artifacts. "Use it on the individual tracks for cumulative benefits. The M-A-S can add consistency as peaks and harsh transients get smoothed and absorbed into the performance, making balancing tracks in the mix easier, and lessening the need for bus limiting down the line. Used on a full mix, the added harmonic content can energize, and add cohesiveness and detail."  
  
Coffee C25 - Chandler Limited REDD 47 or Germanium Preamp  
Description: Punchy and aggressive tubes (REDD 47) or warm and smooth (Germanium).

  
Crimson Fet Hrd - Vertigo VSM (Hard Style FET Crusher) (_thanks dubguy99 via GS_)  
Crimson Fet SFT - Vertigo VSM (Soft Style FET Crusher)  
Description: FETs were designed to emulate the sound of 2nd harmonic generating warm/rich sounding triode tubes.   
Crimson Zen Hrd - Vertigo VSM (Hard Style Zener Blender)   
Crimson Zen SFT - Vertigo VSM (Soft Style Zener Blender)  
Description: Generates third harmonics that bring out the details and brighten a source up. Pentode tube emulation. Can create a compression/limiting effect.

Flame Asym - Evol Audio Fucifier (HF Symmetry bypassed) (_thanks, PhaseLinear via GearSpace_)

Gunmetal F - Jad Freer Audio CAPO F Saturator: (focused on mid frequencies, more vintage inspired)  
Gunmetal J - Jad Freer Audio CAPO J Saturator (huge bottom, aggressive highs)

Mesa - MESA/Boogie Guitar Amp???  
Muff - Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi guitar pedal  
Description: The sound of David Gilmour, Billy Corgan, Kurt Cobain, John Fogerty and Dan Auerbach. Think ripped guitar speaker and that's the fuzz you'll get from the Big Muff!

Saffron SA2 - Looptrotter Sa2Rate (_thanks dubguy99 via GS_)  
Description: Allows engineers to increase RMS without raising peaks for a modern loud sound. Works great on bass, kick drum and mix buss if the high pass filter is used. 

Smoke P500 - Retro Instruments 500PRE  
Description: Uses three 12AT7 tubes. If detail, depth and (when cranked) fatness is what you're after, try the Smoke P500!

Stardust KAR B - elysia Karacter Turbo Boost mode (_thanks synesthetic via GS_)  
Stardust KAR F - elysia Karacter FET Shred mode  
Stardust KAR S - elysia Karacter MS Mode  
Description: Stardust KAR can smooth out a vocal, add texture to a synth or bring out transients in your drums. It has three modes, which makes it a very versatile beast! Try it on the mix buss...this solid state unit was inspired by vintage tube designs!

Taupe FJR - Empirical Labs Fatso Jr.  
Taupe FJR Tran - Empirical Labs Fatso Jr. Tranny Circuit Engaged

Description: FATSO is an acronym for Full Analog Tape Simulator and Optimizer. In simple terms, the FATSO can make your digital recordings sound "less digital". Peaks are tamed, low end bumped, and de-harshening of the mids is what the hardware unit is all about.  
On individual tracks, try the Transformer mode for weight/girth. For mixes, use the one without a transformer.

Taupe SK - Sound Skulptor STS Stereo Tape Simulator  
Description: Similar to the Taupe FJR, this will rounded off transients, introduce some high end roll off and de-harshen the presence area of tracks. Unlike the FATSO which works everywhere, the STS sounds best on individual tracks. As always, your mileage may vary.  
  


Violet CV - Culture Vulture _(thanks snoozebuttonben via GS)  
_ Description: An all tube distortion box design. Violet CV has subtle distortion characteristics, which probably means the Triode type was modeled. It's nice for "warming up" audio sources.  
Zen - Hermida Audio Zendrive  
Description: Smooth guitar overdrive tone. Great for blues, country, jazz, fusion and classic rock styles.

\- Turquoise 6001: TC Electronic System 6000 or Mastering 6000  
\- Wisteria DS1: Weiss Compressor/Limiter DS1

  
*The Magenta D1,Platinum Lim LP, Turquoise 6001 and Wisteria DS1, models with the "2" designation are dual detector modes, which "significantly reduces the perception of distortion."  
  
Preamps available: Midnight, Platinum, Pacific PL-2, Magenta and Tulip.  
  
Usage tips:  
\- Wisteria DS1 2: "The benefit of having separate attack hold and release hold, previously combined into a single lookahead parameter, is the ability to independently adjust the attack from the release. This is incredibly useful as it allows for the enlargement of the transient without compromising compression action."  
  
"Conversely, when using a limiter based on lookahead, adjusting the attack to either anticipate or, in this case, delay it, creating more space for the transient, also delays the release by the same amount. This creates an issue because the release then exhibits a holding action that wasn't intended, potentially losing some of the loudness achievable with the limiter, especially when fine-tuning the release to low values."

**Scarlet** (19) - Homebrew Sontec 432 inspired (close to the original, cleaner sounding) and an original 432C/9 sample. The main difference is the homebrew has 6 dB of range and the new 432C/9 has a +/- 9 dB range. The original may also not sound as "clean" as the vintage hardware clone. (old name was Scarlet MHE-400). "Hyperized" at version 5.

"I've had a lot of success using this on vocals, guitars, drums, and electric pianos. I [can't] think of an application where [I wouldn't be comfortable](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fen.audiofanzine.com%2Fstudio-compressor%2Femt%2F156-Compressor%2F) using this, as it is simply an overall great sounding [versatile] compressor."  
  
"This machine was developed by EMT Franz in 1970. EMT was famous for the EMT 140 plate reverb, the later 240 gold foil and further great reverbs. Also their record players for professional use were famous. Among the other great pro audio gear EMT build is this early PVM compressor.   
The EMT PDM 156 is a compressor/limiter/expander stereo, which has balanced connections on the rear panel and all the classic controls completely programmable by the user. It has a VU meter that displays the gain reduction in the lower part, while in the upper one you can see the response per second of the compressor, or of the limiter if key inserted ATT. A special mention concerns the attack time of the compressor which was set to 2ms from the manufacturer and could be brought to 5ms acting on an internal regulation; while for the limiter the attack time was fixed at 80μs and for the expander it depended on the program. Finally, another feature of this product is that only the compressor and limiter functions could be used individually, while simultaneously the possible combinations were the following: compressor + limiter and compressor + limiter + expander "

**Taupe Studio** (20/Hyper) - Featuring Hyper Tape Emulation Technology (HTET) and five emulated tape machines.

  
• Tudor 810 - [Studer A810](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaudioarchive.com%2FTAA_Tape_Studer_A810.htm) (solid state tracking/recording machine) at 7.5, 15 and 30 inches per second speeds.  
7.5 ips mode has a thicker vintage tone and enhanced low-end. Nice on drums and bass.  
15 ips mode has a balanced tone and smooth saturation. Ideal for vocals, guitars and mix buss.  
30 ips mode is ideal for mastering and detailed sources, due to its lower distortion.  
  


• Tudor 80 - [Studer A80](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Freel-reel.com%2Ftape-recorder%2Fstuder-a-80%2F) (1" 4-track solid state mastering machine) at 15 inches per second tape speed.  
Punchy transients, bold saturation. Great for mix busses.

**Black Series**  
Black EQ - Apparently a mixture of several devices (guesses : Neve 2068 and/or Neve 1077)  
Black Comp - Again, could be a mixture, but smells a lot like a Neve 32264a or Neve 83065, with the addon of different attack times if it is the 32264a, and the lack of 3 release times (100ms and Auto 1&2)  
\- Black limiter : The limiter section of the 32264a or 83065, or a mixture of both.  
  
**Caribou Series** \- Elements from the Neve 8016 console (previously owned by Caribou ranch):  
\- Caribou Mix : Neve 1064 input + output stage + Eq  
\- Caribou Filter : Hi pass + Low pass filters + Input stage (preamp) of the Caribou Mix

# **Offline Acqua Installation (PC Only, VST 2.4)**

_(credit to RJHollins and Will the Weirdo)_

Note: This method is NOT officially supported by Acustica Audio. Whenever they update frameworks, there could be issues. Also, If you haven't enabled file name suffixes/extensions, you will need to. Follow this guide: [https://www.thewindowsclub.com/show-file-extensions-in-windows](https://justpaste.it/redirect/AcusticaAudioAcquaMasterList/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewindowsclub.com%2Fshow-file-extensions-in-windows)  
  
1\. Copy the Acqua folder and associated files from your internet connected DAW's VST location (or the zipped files from your staging area) to your offline DAW's VST folder. You can find these locations in your DAW preferences or the Aquarius preferences Installation tab (gear button, upper right)

Typically these are a folder with [aqua name] so PINK3, for example. This folder contains .N2V files. Then the following files with [aquaname] before them:

.aqu

.dll

.ENG

.N2S

.XML

  
2\. Copy the NEBULAFRAMEWORKx64.aqu file from your internet connected C:\Windows\System32 to your offline DAW's Windows32 folder.

3\. Copy the NEBULAFRAMEWORKx64.aqu file from your internet connected C:\Windows\System32 to your offline DAW's VST folder as well.

  
4\. Copy all the files from the Acqua Staging area's FRAMEWORK/NEBULAFRAMEWORK folder to your offline Windows32 folder. Again, you can find the staging area on the Aquarius' Installation tab, which is inside preferences (gear icon at the upper right corner of the application).

  
5\. Get your authorization from the AA site. Login and then click the stick figure person icon (third from right side) and then click licenses. Copy that .AUT file into the VST folder (same folder as the [aqua name].dll is located. So for the PINK3 plugin look for PINK3.dll . The authorization file should be PINK.aut and so on.

**Core vs. Hyper Technologies:**  
  
"Previously, our products were based on convolution. An equalizer, for instance, is composed of multiple elements, each requiring numerous samples to cover all possible configurations, which are then processed in real-time. The challenge was managing these operations efficiently—loading some from disk, caching others, and ensuring smooth playback. This method allowed for highly accurate emulations but was inherently slow, as large amounts of data had to be processed on demand. Adjusting a band could take seconds, depending on disk speed, RAM, and overall system performance.  
  
With Hyper technology, this system was completely redesigned. Instead of loading everything dynamically, essential data is now kept in memory, making the response nearly instantaneous. However, storing all samples in memory would require an enormous amount of space, so we developed a hybrid approach where part of the data is stored, and part is reconstructed in real-time. This process relies on a convergence algorithm to accurately recreate the missing portions. If the reconstruction isn’t precise, the result can be unusable, so finding the right balance is critical.  
  
The key point is that this type of reconstruction not only allows us to match the previous system but also to surpass its quality by enabling much longer tails. This is just one example of how it applies to filters and equalizers. So, the improvements aren’t just about reducing CPU load—the sound quality is also better.  
  
The downside, however, is that this approach isn’t always feasible. Some products can transition smoothly, while others would require entirely new methods to maintain accuracy, making the process much more complex.  
  
This is why not all older products can be updated. Each upgrade requires developing new methods to maintain the same sonic accuracy while significantly reducing memory usage and improving performance. Newer products like Daisy or Rice integrate these advancements, gradually allowing us to bring previous products into the new system. However, this transition is complex, as the newer techniques must not only be more efficient but also perfectly match the sound of older models. This remains an ongoing challenge in our development process.  
  
Regarding distortion, we have always broken down the distortion of elements into a linear component and an actual distortion component. For example, in the case of an equalizer, we separate it into a preamp section and a mostly linear EQ section. Sometimes, the equalizer itself introduces harmonic distortion, but in general, the filtering stage can be approximated as a linear process, with the distortion applied separately in what we refer to as the preamp stage.
