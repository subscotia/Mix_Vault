An IDE as powerful as PyCharm has hundreds of features, and most users only ever touch a fraction of them. Mastering a few key features can dramatically increase your productivity.

Here are 10 hidden or underused PyCharm features that you will likely use every day once you know them.

---

**1\. Search Everywhere: Your Global Compass**

* **Shortcut:** Double-Tap Shift  
* **What it does:** This is the single most powerful feature in PyCharm. It opens a search bar that looks for anything and everything: files, actions, settings, classes, symbols, and more. If you want to do something but don't know the menu or shortcut, just double-tap Shift and start typing what you want to do (e.g., "reformat code," "toggle dark mode," "find in files"). It's a command palette for the entire IDE.

**2\. Show Context Actions: The Magic Wand**

* **Shortcut:** Alt+Enter  
* **What it does:** Whenever you see a yellow lightbulb, or your cursor is on a piece of code (especially one with a colored underline), press Alt+Enter. PyCharm will show you a list of relevant actions you can take. This includes automatically fixing errors, importing missing libraries, creating new functions, refactoring code, or even converting a string to an f-string. This is the primary way you "ask" the IDE for help.

**3\. Local History: The Time Machine You Didn't Know You Had**

* **What it does:** PyCharm automatically records a history of all your changes to a file, completely independent of Git. If you accidentally delete a block of code, mess something up, and save the file, you can right-click anywhere in the editor, go to Local History \> Show History, and see a diff view of all the changes you've made. You can then revert to any previous state. It is a lifesaver.

**4\. Extend/Shrink Selection: The Smart Selector**

* **Shortcut:** Ctrl+W (Extend) / Ctrl+Shift+W (Shrink)  
* **What it does:** Instead of carefully selecting code with your mouse, place your cursor on a variable and press Ctrl+W. It will select the variable. Press it again, it selects the entire statement. Again, it selects the function body. Again, the whole function. It intelligently expands the selection based on the code's structure. Ctrl+Shift+W does the reverse.

**5\. Scratch Files: A No-Mess Notepad**

* **Shortcut:** Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Insert  
* **What it does:** Often, you want to test a small snippet of Python code without creating a new .py file in your project. Scratch files are temporary, runnable files that are not part of your project structure. They have full syntax highlighting and code completion. It is the perfect place to test an API call or a data transformation idea.

**6\. Conditional Breakpoints: The Precision Debugger**

* **What it does:** Everyone knows how to set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter. But if that breakpoint is inside a loop that runs 10,000 times, it is useless. Instead, right-click on the red breakpoint dot. You can enter a condition (e.g., i \== 9500 or some\_variable is None). The debugger will now only pause execution when that exact condition is true, saving you an enormous amount of time.

**7\. Go to Recent Files: Your Short-Term Memory**

* **Shortcut:** Ctrl+E  
* **What it does:** Instead of hunting through the project tree for a file you were just working on, this shortcut brings up a pop-up of all your recently viewed files. Start typing to filter the list and press Enter to jump straight to it. A much faster way to navigate between active files.

**8\. Rename Refactoring: The Safe Rename**

* **Shortcut:** Shift+F6  
* **What it does:** Never manually rename a function or variable using find-and-replace. Instead, place your cursor on what you want to rename and press Shift+F6. PyCharm understands the code and will safely rename all usages of that specific function or variable across your entire project, without accidentally renaming something else with the same name in a string or comment.

**9\. The Integrated Database Navigator**

* **What it does:** On the far right side of the IDE, there is a tab for Database. You can configure this to connect directly to almost any database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.). This allows you to browse tables, write and execute SQL queries, and even view schemas, all without leaving your IDE. For data engineering, this is incredibly powerful.

**10\. The Built-in HTTP Client**

* **What it does:** You can create a file ending in .http or .rest. In this file, you can write simple HTTP requests to test APIs (e.g., GET https://api.github.com/users/google). A green "run" icon appears next to the request, allowing you to send it and see the full response, including headers and the JSON body, formatted nicely within the IDE. It replaces the need for external tools like Postman for many common tasks.
