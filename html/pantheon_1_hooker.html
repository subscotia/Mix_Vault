    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Muddy Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, non-linear SPA with a sticky navigation bar (The Man, The Sound, The Career, The Pantheon). This structure abandons the report's linear flow to empower user-driven exploration. Users can jump between Hooker's biography, his unique musical style, his career evolution via an interactive timeline, and his legacy compared to peers. This approach transforms a static document into an engaging, multi-faceted interactive resource, prioritizing discovery over sequential reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    - **Life Journey:** (Inform) -> Interactive CSS Map -> Click cities for info -> More engaging than text.
    - **Career Path:** (Change) -> Interactive Bubble Timeline (Chart.js) -> Click bubbles to show era details -> Visualizes a 50+ year career dynamically, better than a static table.
    - **Peer Comparison:** (Compare) -> Side-by-side HTML columns -> Direct visual comparison -> Highlights his unique qualities instantly.
    - **Awards:** (Inform) -> CSS "Trophy Case" Grid -> Hover for details -> More prestigious and visually interesting than a list.
    - **Musical Style:** (Explain) -> Text with emphasis -> Simple, direct explanation of a complex topic without needing audio plugins.

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">John Lee Hooker's journey is a story of the Great Migration, from the oppressive cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta to the industrial clamor of Detroit. This section explores the world that forged him and the path he took, absorbing the traditions of his environment while cultivating a sound that was entirely his own.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Born into a sharecropping family in the Mississippi Delta around 1917, Hooker's world was defined by the economic bondage of the plantation system and the rigid racial hierarchy of Jim Crow. His father, a Baptist preacher, forbade secular music, limiting his early exposure to church spirituals. The pivotal moment came when his mother married Will Moore, a local bluesman who played a droning, one-chord style learned in Louisiana—a sound radically different from the mainstream Delta blues. This became the foundation of Hooker's musical DNA, making him an outlier from his very first lesson.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">The enduring power of John Lee Hooker's music lies in a set of unique stylistic signatures that are instantly recognizable. His revolutionary approach to guitar, voice, and song structure created a sound that was his and his alone, rooted not in melodic complexity but in the primal, hypnotic power of rhythm.</p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
                    <article class="p-6 bg-stone-50 rounded-lg">
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Hypnotic Groove</h3>
                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Learned from his stepfather, Hooker's trademark was the "one-chord blues." He used open tunings to create a mesmerizing, droning foundation. His rhythm was a relentless, driving syncopation, often anchored by the steady, metronomic stomp of his own foot. Famously "free-form," he ignored standard meter, adding or dropping beats to fit the song's emotion. This made him a musical iconoclast, notoriously difficult for other musicians to follow.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Hooker's voice was as unique as his guitar playing—a deep, gruff baritone that carried the weight of a lifetime. His trademark was the "talking blues," a half-spoken, half-sung delivery where his narrative floated over the relentless guitar rhythm. His voice could be menacing, plaintiff, or ruminative, but it was always authentic. As he said, "Every song I sing is something that happened... That's why everybody digs the blues… it has more feeling."</p>
