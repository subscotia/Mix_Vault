# Extract Unique Field Values and Export to JSO
#- Extracts all the unique values from a specific field (like "developer").
#- Then it writes those into a new JSON file where the field name becomes the key, and the list of unique values becomes the content.

# Enter the file path of your vault here:
vault_file = "vault_instr_wip.json"

# Enter the field you want to scan for unique values:
target_field = "developer"  # You can change this to "host", "tags", "type", etc.

# This will be your output file:
output_file = f"{target_field}_catalog.json"

# Run the extraction:
extract_unique_field_values(vault_file, target_field, output_file)
