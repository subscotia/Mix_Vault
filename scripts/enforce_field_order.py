enforce_field_order.py

üéØ PURPOSE:
Rewrites a vault JSON file to ensure that the keys (fields) within each
entry are in a specific, consistent order. This improves readability and
makes manual comparison of entries easier.

üõ°Ô∏è SAFE:
- Does not alter any data values; it only changes the order of the keys.
- If an entry has keys that are not in the specified order list, they will be
  preserved and moved to the end of the entry. No data is lost.
- Creates a timestamped backup of the original vault before saving changes.

üîß TWEAKABLE CONFIGURATION:
- You can change the vault file and the desired field order in the
  '--- CONFIGURATION ---' block.
