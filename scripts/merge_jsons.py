üéØ PURPOSE:
Merges two vault JSON files into a single output file. It includes logic to
handle duplicate entries based on a specified conflict resolution rule.

üõ°Ô∏è SAFE:
- Uses a configurable set of fields (e.g., 'name', 'filename') to identify
  unique entries.
- When a duplicate is found, it keeps the entry from the secondary file only
  if the primary entry is missing a value in a specified 'conflict field'
  (e.g., 'developer').
- Creates a timestamped backup of the output file before overwriting it.

üîß TWEAKABLE CONFIGURATION:
- All file paths and logical parameters can be changed in the
  '--- CONFIGURATION ---' block below.
